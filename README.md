#OnTheGoDesigner

-In today's age where new technologies are coming up everyday and competition in the world of software engineering and development is
at its acme, it is really important for developers to be well-versed in multiple aspects of the development process.
 
-It can be overwhelmingly difficult to learn and be in touch with such a plethora of programming languages and tools while juggling
between professional or academic life.

-To make this process a bit easier we have come up with a unique application that allows you to develop the front end of an application   on the go without writing a single line of code.

-All you need to do is draw your layout and mention the specifications of the application and the tool will smartly develop the front end design and layout of the code in a javascript file that can be directly be used or it will generate the code that needs to be written to develop the file.

-Technology stack:
1)Python 3.5
2)Javascript 
3)Pytessarect
4)Android Studio
